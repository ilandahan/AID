# Name
> AID (AI Development Methodology)

# Description
> A comprehensive, end-to-end framework for AI-assisted software development that transforms raw requirements into production-ready software using Claude Code with integrated MCP services.

# Author
> Ilan Dahan

# Repository
> https://github.com/ilandahan/AID

# Documentation Files
> llm.txt - Standard LLM context file
> llms.txt - Short summary
> llms-full.txt - Comprehensive documentation
> CLAUDE.md - Claude Code instructions
> README.md - Main documentation

# Core Concept
> 5-phase gated methodology with human approval between phases:
> 1. PRD - Product Requirements
> 2. Tech Spec - Architecture Design
> 3. Breakdown - Jira Task Creation
> 4. Development - TDD Implementation
> 5. QA & Ship - Review and Deploy

# Key Features
> - Phase gate enforcement (prevents premature coding)
> - Context tracking (session continuity)
> - MCP integrations (Jira, Figma, GitHub, Chrome)
> - Specialized skills (atomic-design, TDD, code-review)
> - 21 slash commands

# Technology Stack
> Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Jest

# Essential Commands
> /good-morning - Daily startup
> /phase - Show current phase
> /phase-approve - Human sign-off
> /phase-advance - Move to next phase

# State Files
> .aid/state.json - Phase state
> .aid/context.json - Work context

# Optional
