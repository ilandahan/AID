AID (AI Development Methodology) - Quick Reference

AID is a phase-gated methodology for Claude Code that enforces structured development: PRD → Tech Spec → Breakdown → Development → QA & Ship.

CORE COMPONENTS

1. Phase Gates (Enforced Sequential Progression)
   - Phase 1 PRD: Requirements, scope, user stories
   - Phase 2 Tech Spec: Architecture, schemas, APIs
   - Phase 3 Breakdown: Jira epics, stories, tasks
   - Phase 4 Development: Code, tests, components
   - Phase 5 QA & Ship: Testing, review, deployment

   State tracked in .aid/state.json with entry/exit criteria.

2. Context Tracking (.aid/context.json)
   Maintains real-time tracking:
   - Previous/Current/Next task
   - Previous/Current/Next step within task
   - Session log with timestamps
   Used by /good-morning for continuity.

3. Skills System (Auto-loaded by Phase)
   - phase-enforcement: Blocks out-of-order work
   - context-tracking: Task/step management
   - system-architect: Phase 2 architecture
   - atomic-design: Phase 4 design systems
   - code-review: Phase 5 review
   - test-driven: Phase 4-5 TDD

4. Memory System (Learning from Feedback)
   - Feedback collected at phase end
   - Patterns detected automatically
   - Skills updated based on patterns
   - Insights promoted to Claude Memory
   - 30 slots for persistent learning

5. MCP Integrations
   Jira/Confluence, GitHub, Figma, Chrome DevTools, PostgreSQL

ESSENTIAL COMMANDS

Daily: /good-morning, /context, /phase
Phase Management: /aid-init, /gate-check, /phase-approve, /phase-advance
Development: /prd, /tech-spec, /jira-breakdown, /write-tests, /code-review
Learning: /aid-improve, /aid-memory

CRITICAL RULES
1. Read .aid/state.json before starting work
2. REFUSE work that belongs to future phases
3. Update .aid/context.json when starting/completing tasks
4. Use TDD in Phase 4 (write tests before code)
5. Get approval before advancing phases

TECH STACK
Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, Node.js 18+, PostgreSQL 16+, Jest, Docker

STATUS FILES
.aid/state.json - Current phase and phase status
.aid/context.json - Current task, step, progress
.aid/approvals/ - Phase approval markers
