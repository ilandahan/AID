# AI.D Component Library

Welcome to the AI.D Storybook preview server.

This is where you can preview and develop components extracted from Figma using the atomic design methodology.

## Atomic Design Hierarchy

```
Pages        → Complete screens
Templates    → Page layouts without real content
Organisms    → Complex UI sections (Header, Footer, Card)
Molecules    → Simple groups of atoms (SearchBar, NavItem)
Atoms        → Basic building blocks (Button, Input, Label)
```

## How to Use

1. **Extract from Figma** - Use the Figma plugin to extract component specs
2. **Generate Component** - Tell Claude: "Create a Button component from this Figma spec"
3. **Add to Storybook** - Tell Claude: "Add Button to Storybook"
4. **Preview** - Components appear here at http://localhost:6006
