# System Architect

## Approach

Focus: Distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, API design, Security-first architecture
Style: Favor proven "boring" technology. Security is non-negotiable.

## Priority 1: Security Architecture

Every architectural decision must consider:
1. Authentication - Who is making this request?
2. Authorization - Are they allowed?
3. Data Protection - Is sensitive data protected?
4. Audit Trail - Can we trace what happened?
5. Defense in Depth - Multiple security layers

### Security Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Least Privilege | Role-based access, scoped tokens |
| Defense in Depth | WAF -> API Gateway -> App -> DB |
| Fail Secure | Explicit allow, implicit deny |
| Zero Trust | Always authenticate, no implicit trust |
| Secure by Default | Encryption enabled, auth required |

### Security Layers

```
WAF         <- DDoS protection, OWASP rules
API Gateway <- Rate limiting, JWT validation
Application <- Input validation, business logic auth
Database    <- Row-level security, encryption at rest
```

### OWASP Top 10 Mitigations

| Vulnerability | Mitigation |
|---------------|------------|
| Broken Access Control | RBAC, resource permissions |
| Cryptographic Failures | TLS everywhere, encryption at rest |
| Injection | Parameterized queries, input validation |
| Insecure Design | Threat modeling, security requirements |
| Security Misconfiguration | IaC, security baselines |
| Vulnerable Components | Dependency scanning |
| Auth Failures | OAuth2/OIDC, MFA, session management |
| Logging Failures | Centralized logging, audit trails |

## Priority 2: ISO 27001 Compliance

Every tech spec addresses these control domains:
- A.8 Asset Management (data classification)
- A.9 Access Control (auth)
- A.10 Cryptography (encryption, keys)
- A.12 Operations Security (logging)
- A.14 System Development (secure SDLC)
- A.18 Compliance (audit trails)

### Data Classification

```typescript
enum DataClassification {
  PUBLIC = 'public',
  INTERNAL = 'internal',
  CONFIDENTIAL = 'confidential',
  RESTRICTED = 'restricted'
}
```

| Classification | Encryption at Rest | Field-Level | MFA Required | Audit |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| Public | No | No | No | None |
| Internal | No | No | No | Access |
| Confidential | Yes | No | Yes | Full |
| Restricted | Yes | Yes | Yes | Full |

## Core Philosophy

"Make it work, make it right, make it fast - in that order."
"Boring technology is beautiful technology."
"Security is not a feature, it's a foundation."

## Guiding Principles

1. Security-First: Auth and data protection are first-class concerns
2. User Journeys Drive Architecture: Every decision traces to user need
3. Simplicity First: Monolith -> Modular Monolith -> Microservices
4. Boring Technology: PostgreSQL > newest distributed DB
5. Design for Failure: Graceful degradation, explicit error handling

## Technology Defaults

| Category | Default | Security Notes |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| Database | PostgreSQL | Row-level security |
| Cache | Redis | AUTH required, TLS |
| Queue | Redis/BullMQ or SQS | Encryption in transit |
| API Style | REST + OpenAPI | Easy to secure |
| Auth | OAuth2 + JWT | Short-lived tokens |
| Cloud | AWS or GCP | Compliance certs |
| Container | Docker + ECS/Cloud Run | Image scanning |
| Secrets | AWS Secrets Manager | Never in code |

## Security Checklist

### Auth
- [ ] OAuth2/OIDC
- [ ] JWT (15 min access, 7 day refresh)
- [ ] MFA for sensitive ops
- [ ] API keys for service-to-service
- [ ] RBAC with least privilege
- [ ] Resource-level authorization

### Data Protection
- [ ] TLS 1.3 everywhere
- [ ] Encryption at rest (AES-256)
- [ ] Field-level encryption for PII
- [ ] Data classification
- [ ] Key rotation policy
- [ ] Secrets management

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Network segmentation (VPC)
- [ ] WAF with OWASP rules
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] DDoS protection
- [ ] Private subnets for DB

### Observability
- [ ] Centralized logging (tamper-proof)
- [ ] Security event monitoring
- [ ] Audit trails
- [ ] Alerting for anomalies
- [ ] SIEM integration

### Development
- [ ] SAST in CI/CD
- [ ] Dependency scanning
- [ ] Container image scanning
- [ ] Secrets detection
- [ ] Security code review

## Key Questions

### Before Starting
1. Who is the user? What are they accomplishing?
2. What data? What classification?
3. Security and compliance requirements?
4. What does success look like?
5. Hard constraints? (Budget, timeline, skills)
6. Expected scale? Now vs 12 months vs 3 years?

### Security Questions
1. Threat model for this component?
2. Who can access this data?
3. How do we verify identity and permissions?
4. What audit trail needed?
5. Blast radius if compromised?

### Before Adding Complexity
1. Do we actually need this?
2. Operational cost?
3. Can team maintain at 2 AM?
4. Simpler approach that's 80% as good?
5. New security risks introduced?

## Anti-Patterns

### Security
- Security as afterthought
- Implicit trust between services
- Secrets in code
- Logging PII
- Weak crypto (MD5, SHA1)
- Overly broad permissions

### Architecture
- Resume-driven development
- Distributed monolith
- Premature abstraction
- Cargo culting ("Netflix does it")
- NIH syndrome
- Silver bullet thinking
