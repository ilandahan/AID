## Interview Flow Template

### Opening (5 minutes)
```
"Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. I'm [name]
and I'm researching [topic area] to understand [goal].

This conversation is about learning from your experience -
there are no right or wrong answers. I'm here to understand, not to sell.

Do you mind if I take notes? [If recording: May I record for accuracy?]

Before we start, do you have any questions for me?"
```

### Warm-up (5 minutes)
```
"To start, could you tell me a bit about your role and
how long you've been doing this?"

"What does a typical day look like for you?"
```

### Core Exploration (40-50 minutes)
Use questions from the Question Bank, following the interviewee's lead.

**Key techniques:**
- **Mirror**: Repeat the last 3 words they said as a question
- **Label**: "It sounds like that was frustrating..."
- **Silence**: Wait 3-5 seconds after they finish
- **Dig deeper**: "Tell me more about that..."

### Future State (10 minutes)
```
"If you could wave a magic wand and have the perfect solution,
what would it do?"

"What would make you say 'this is exactly what I needed'?"

"What would success look like a year from now?"
```

### Closing (5 minutes)
```
"What question should I have asked but didn't?"

"Who else would you recommend I speak with?"

"Is there anything else you'd like to add?"

"Thank you so much for your time. This has been incredibly valuable.
May I follow up if I have additional questions?"
```

## Active Listening Techniques

### The TEDW Framework
- **T**ell me more about...
- **E**xplain what you mean by...
- **D**escribe a time when...
- **W**alk me through...

### Mirroring
Repeat the last 1-3 words as a question:
> Interviewee: "...and that's when everything fell apart"
> You: "Fell apart?"

### Labeling Emotions
Name the emotion you're sensing:
> "It sounds like that was really frustrating"
> "It seems like that made you feel uncertain"

### Strategic Silence
After they answer, wait 3-5 seconds before responding. They often fill the silence with deeper insights.

### Summarizing
Periodically summarize what you've heard:
> "So if I understand correctly, the main issues are X, Y, and Z?"
