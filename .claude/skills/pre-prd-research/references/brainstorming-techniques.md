## Divergent Techniques (Generate Ideas)

### 1. Classic Brainstorm

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes
**Format**: Group
**Best for**: General idea generation

**Process:**
1. State the challenge as "How Might We..."
2. Set timer for 10 minutes
3. Everyone calls out ideas
4. Facilitator writes ALL ideas (no filtering)
5. Build on others with "Yes, and..."
6. Push for 30+ ideas

**Example HMW Statements:**
- "How might we make onboarding feel effortless?"
- "How might we help users find value in the first 5 minutes?"
- "How might we reduce support tickets by 50%?"

---

### 2. SCAMPER Method

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes
**Format**: Structured prompts
**Best for**: Improving existing solutions

**Process:**
Go through each letter, applying it to your product/problem:

| Letter | Prompt | Example Questions |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| **S**ubstitute | What can we replace? | Different tech? Different process? Different people? |
| **C**ombine | What can we merge? | Combine features? Combine with another product? |
| **A**dapt | What else is like this? | What can we copy from another industry? |
| **M**odify | What can we change? | Make bigger/smaller? Faster/slower? Simpler/richer? |
| **P**ut to other use | Other applications? | Different users? Different context? |
| **E**liminate | What can we remove? | What if we had no [feature]? What's unnecessary? |
| **R**everse | What if opposite? | Flip the process? Reverse the order? |

**Template:**
```markdown
## SCAMPER Session: [Topic]
**Traceability Prefix**: [PROJECT]-B-IDEA-

### Substitute
- What if we replaced [X] with [Y]?
  - Idea: [ID: XXX]

### Combine
- What if we combined [X] and [Y]?
  - Idea: [ID: XXX]

### Adapt
- What works in [other industry] that we could use?
  - Idea: [ID: XXX]

### Modify
- What if we made [X] 10x [bigger/smaller/faster]?
  - Idea: [ID: XXX]

### Put to Other Use
- Who else could use this?
  - Idea: [ID: XXX]

### Eliminate
- What if we removed [feature/step] entirely?
  - Idea: [ID: XXX]

### Reverse
- What if we did [opposite action]?
  - Idea: [ID: XXX]
```

### 3. Crazy 8s

**Duration**: 8 minutes exactly
**Format**: Individual sketching
**Best for**: Visual concepts, UI ideas, quick iterations

**Process:**
1. Fold paper into 8 sections
2. Set timer for 8 minutes
3. Sketch one idea per section (1 minute each)
4. No talking during sketching
5. Share and discuss after

**Tips:**
- Sketches can be rough (stick figures OK)
- Words are allowed
- If stuck, vary one element of previous idea
- Timer creates productive pressure

**Variations:**
- Crazy 4s (2 min each, more detail)
- Crazy 16s (30 sec each, more quantity)

---

### 4. Worst Possible Idea

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes
**Format**: Group
**Best for**: Breaking creative blocks, team fun

**Process:**
1. State the problem
2. Ask: "What's the WORST possible solution?"
3. Generate terrible ideas (5 min)
4. Pick the worst ideas
5. Reverse them into good ideas (5 min)

**Example:**
```
Problem: "How might we improve customer onboarding?"

Worst Ideas:
- Make users fill out 100 forms
- Require a 2-hour training video
- Delete their account if they make a mistake

Reversed:
- Zero forms - we figure out everything automatically
- Learning by doing, no training needed
- Celebrate mistakes as learning opportunities
```

---

### 5. Random Word Association

**Duration**: 15 minutes
**Format**: Group
**Best for**: Breaking mental patterns, unexpected connections

**Process:**
1. Generate random word (use generator or dictionary)
2. List 5-10 attributes of that word
3. Force connections between attributes and problem
4. Capture ideas that emerge

**Example:**
```
Problem: "How might we make data analysis easier?"
Random Word: "Restaurant"

Restaurant Attributes:
- Menu (choices)
- Waiter (service)
- Kitchen (hidden work)
- Reservation (booking ahead)
- Bill (payment at end)

Forced Connections:
- "Menu" → What if data analysis had a menu of common queries?
- "Waiter" → What if AI suggested what analysis you might want?
- "Kitchen" → What if complex processing was hidden?
- "Reservation" → What if you could schedule reports ahead?
- "Bill" → What if you only paid based on insights gained?
```

### 6. Six Thinking Hats

**Duration**: 30-40 minutes
**Format**: Structured group discussion
**Best for**: Comprehensive exploration, balanced perspectives

**Process:**
Everyone "wears" the same hat at the same time:

| Hat | Focus | Duration | Key Question |
|-----|-------|----------|--------------|
| White | Facts & Data | 5 min | "What do we know for sure?" |
| Red | Emotions & Intuition | 3 min | "What's your gut feeling?" |
| Black | Risks & Problems | 5 min | "What could go wrong?" |
| Yellow | Benefits & Value | 5 min | "What's good about this?" |
| Green | Creativity & Alternatives | 10 min | "What else could we try?" |
| Blue | Process & Summary | 5 min | "What did we learn? What's next?" |

**Facilitation Script:**
```
[White Hat - 5 min]
"Let's focus only on facts. No opinions or judgments.
What data do we have? What do we know for certain?"

[Red Hat - 3 min]
"Now, pure emotion. No justification needed.
How do you feel about this? What's your gut saying?"

[Black Hat - 5 min]
"Devil's advocate time. What are the risks?
What could fail? What are the obstacles?"

[Yellow Hat - 5 min]
"Optimism only. What are the benefits?
Why would this work? What's the upside?"

[Green Hat - 10 min]
"Creative mode. Alternatives and new ideas.
What else could we try? Build on the ideas."

[Blue Hat - 5 min]
"Process check. What did we learn?
What are the key insights? What's the next step?"
```

### 7. Role Storming

**Duration**: 20 minutes
**Format**: Character play
**Best for**: Fresh perspectives, empathy building

**Process:**
1. Pick 3-5 personas/characters
2. Brainstorm as if you WERE that person
3. Use first person: "I would..."
4. Stay in character

**Persona Examples:**
- Your customer
- A 5-year-old child
- Elon Musk
- Your grandmother
- A competitor
- A first-time user
- An expert power user

**Template:**
```markdown
## Role Storming: [Problem]

### As [Persona 1]
"I would want..."
- Idea: [ID: XXX]

### As [Persona 2]
"I would need..."
- Idea: [ID: XXX]

### As [Persona 3]
"I would expect..."
- Idea: [ID: XXX]
```

### 8. 10x Thinking

**Duration**: 15 minutes
**Format**: Constraint removal
**Best for**: Breakthrough thinking, moonshots

**Process:**
1. State current state/metric
2. Ask: "How would we make this 10x better?"
3. No incremental improvements allowed
4. Assume unlimited resources
5. Work backwards from 10x to find stepping stones

**Prompt:**
"If we had to make this 10x better (not 10% better), what would we do differently? Assume we had unlimited budget, team, and time."

**Example:**
```
Current: Onboarding takes 20 minutes
10x better: Onboarding takes 2 minutes (or zero!)

To achieve 2-minute onboarding:
- Eliminate forms entirely
- Auto-import from existing tools
- AI personalizes everything
- No configuration needed
- Value visible in first 30 seconds
```

## Convergent Techniques (Evaluate Ideas)

### Dot Voting

**Duration**: 5-10 minutes
**Format**: Democratic selection
**Best for**: Quick prioritization from many ideas

**Process:**
1. Each person gets 3-5 dots (stickers or marks)
2. Vote on favorite ideas (can put multiple dots on one)
3. Count votes
4. Top 3-5 move forward

**Variations:**
- $100 voting: Allocate $100 across ideas
- Category voting: 1 dot for "feasible", 1 for "impactful"

---

### Impact/Effort Matrix

**Duration**: 15 minutes
**Format**: 2x2 prioritization
**Best for**: Practical prioritization

```
                    HIGH IMPACT
                         │
                         │
     QUICK WINS          │     BIG BETS
     Do first!           │     Plan carefully
                         │
    LOW ─────────────────┼───────────────── HIGH
    EFFORT               │                 EFFORT
                         │
     FILL-INS            │     THANKLESS TASKS
     Do if time          │     Avoid/delegate
                         │
                    LOW IMPACT
```

**Process:**
1. Draw the matrix on whiteboard
2. Take each idea from brainstorm
3. Group discusses placement
4. Focus on Quick Wins first

### Now/Next/Later

**Duration**: 10 minutes
**Format**: Timeline prioritization
**Best for**: Roadmap thinking

| Category | Criteria | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|

## Session Facilitation

### Facilitation Script

```markdown
## Pre-Session (5 min before)

"Welcome everyone! Today we're going to generate ideas for [topic].
Remember our ground rules:
- No criticism during ideation
- Quantity over quality
- Wild ideas are encouraged
- Build on each other's ideas

Our goal is [X] ideas in [Y] minutes. Ready?"

## During Session

Energy low? Try:
- "Let's stand up for this next round"
- "What's the craziest version of this idea?"
- "Yes, and what else?"
- "What would [famous person] do?"

Silence? Try:
- "Let's do 2 minutes of silent writing first"
- "Turn to your neighbor and share one idea"
- "I'll start with a bad idea to break the ice"

Dominant voice? Try:
- "Let's hear from someone who hasn't shared yet"
- "Everyone write one idea silently, then we'll share"
- "Round robin - everyone shares one idea"

## Post-Session

"Great session! We generated [X] ideas.
Before we close:
1. What surprised you?
2. What are you excited about?
3. What questions do we still have?

Next step: We'll cluster and prioritize these ideas."
```

### Energy Management

| Time | Energy Level | Technique to Use |
|------|--------------|------------------|
| Start | Building | Warm-up, easy prompts |
| 10 min | Peak | Challenging prompts, constraints |
| 20 min | Dipping | Stand up, change format |
| 30 min | Fatiguing | Break or wrap up |
