## Facilitation Tips

### Do
- Ask open-ended questions
- Capture everything, filter later
- Encourage quiet voices
- Challenge assumptions
- Quantify whenever possible

### Don't
- Jump to solutions
- Let one person dominate
- Dismiss concerns
- Accept vague answers
- Skip stakeholders

## Problem Validation Techniques

### 5 Whys Example
```
Statement: "We need a new dashboard"
Why? → "Current one is slow"
Why? → "Too much data loading"
Why? → "Users need all metrics at once"
Why? → "They're comparing across regions"
Why? → "Regional performance isn't visible easily"

Root Problem: Regional performance comparison is difficult
Solution might not be: New dashboard
Solution might be: Regional summary view
```
