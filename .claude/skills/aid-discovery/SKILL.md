# Discovery Phase Skill

## Phase Overview

Purpose: Validate problem space before committing to solution.

Entry: Initial idea/request exists, stakeholders available
Exit: Problem validated, stakeholders identified, success metrics defined, go/no-go decision

## Deliverables

1. Problem Statement (SCQ format) - Validated, no solution assumptions
2. Stakeholder Map - All affected parties identified
3. Success Metrics - Quantified, measurable outcomes

## Discovery Questions

### Understanding Problem
- What problem are we solving?
- Who has this problem?
- How painful? (Quantify)
- What if we don't solve it?

### Identifying Stakeholders
- Who are end users?
- Who owns data/process?
- Who makes decisions?
- Who else touches this?

### Defining Success
- What does success look like?
- How will we measure?
- What's minimum viable outcome?

### Technical Feasibility
- Is this feasible?
- Major technical risks?
- Required skills?
- Infrastructure needs?

## Problem Statement Template (SCQ)

```markdown
## Problem Statement

### Situation
[Current state]

### Complication
[What's wrong]

### Question
[What solving this answers]

### Impact
- [Quantified impact]

### Success Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| [Metric] | [Now] | [Goal] |
```

## Stakeholder Map Template

```markdown
### Decision Makers
- [Name/Role]: [Responsibility]

### Data/System Owners
- [Name/Role]: [What they own]

### End Users
- [Type]: [How affected]

### Integrations
- [System]: [Relationship]
```

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Solution-first | Start with "what problem?" |
| Missing stakeholders | Ask "who else touches this?" |
| Vague problems | If can't measure, not defined |
| Assumption blindness | Make assumptions explicit |

## Phase Gate Checklist

- [ ] Problem statement validated
- [ ] All stakeholders identified
- [ ] Success metrics specific
- [ ] Technical feasibility assessed
- [ ] Proceed/not-proceed decision clear
- [ ] Scope boundaries established

## Handoff to PRD

- Validated problem statement
- Stakeholder map
- Success metrics
- Constraints identified
- Scope boundaries
