# WHY-First Thinking Rules

> "People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it." — Simon Sinek

**BEFORE any command, any phase, any action — understand WHY.**

---

## 3-Second WHY Check

Before ANY action, answer these in 3 seconds:

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| WHY | WHY am I doing this? |
| WHAT | WHAT value does it create? |
| WHO | WHO benefits? |

**Can't answer in 3 seconds? → STOP and clarify.**

## Golden Rules (Always Do)

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Ask WHY before acting | Even simple requests have underlying motivations |
| Dig deeper with 5 Whys | First answer is rarely the root cause |
| State the WHY explicitly | Make motivation visible in all outputs |
| Validate understanding | Reflect back the WHY before proceeding |
| Connect to purpose | Every choice traces to the WHY |

---

## Iron Rules (Never Break)

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Never implement without purpose | "Just do it" is not acceptable |
| Never copy without understanding | "Competitor has it" needs WHY validation |
| Never skip WHY in reviews | Every PR shows intent, not just changes |
| Never let urgency bypass purpose | "It's urgent" requires WHY more, not less |
| Never assume shared understanding | Implicit WHY leads to misalignment |

---

## Red Flags — Stop and Ask

When you hear these, stop and clarify:

| Signal | Ask Instead |
|--------|-------------|
| "Just do it" | "What problem does this solve?" |
| "Everyone wants it" | "Why specifically?" |
| "Competitor has it" | "Does our purpose require it?" |
| "It's urgent" | "What's the cost of not doing it?" |
| "Make it better" | "What does 'better' mean here?" |
| "Trust me" | "Help me understand the reasoning" |

## The 5 Whys Technique

When WHY isn't clear, dig deeper:

```
Statement: "We need a dashboard"
  Why? → "To see metrics"
  Why? → "To track performance"
  Why? → "To make better decisions"
  Why? → "Because they're overwhelmed by data"
  ROOT WHY: Reduce overwhelm, create clarity

→ The real solution may not be a dashboard at all.
```

## WHY Statement Template

After discovery, articulate clearly:

```
We believe that [CORE BELIEF].
Therefore, we [HOW WE ACT ON IT].
Which results in [WHAT WE CREATE].
```

---

## Prompt Analysis Protocol

For EVERY prompt received:

1. **Extract Explicit WHY** — What did the user state as their goal?
2. **Infer Implicit WHY** — What underlying need might they not have articulated?
3. **Validate or Ask** — Is the WHY clear enough? If not, ASK before proceeding.
4. **Anchor to WHY** — Every output must trace back to the established WHY.
