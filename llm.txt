AID - AI Development Methodology for Claude Code

PROJECT OVERVIEW
AID is a comprehensive framework that transforms raw requirements into production-ready software using Claude Code and AI assistance. It systematizes the entire development journey with structured phases, phase gates, skills system, and memory learning.

CORE PURPOSE
Provide a methodical, enforced workflow for building full-stack applications with Claude Code assistance. The methodology ensures quality, consistency, and progressive disclosure of work through phase gates.

KEY FEATURES
- Phase Gates (5 phases): PRD → Tech Spec → Breakdown → Development → QA & Ship
- Phase Enforcement: Work is blocked out-of-order, critical rule enforced
- Context Tracking: Real-time tracking of tasks/steps in .aid/context.json
- Skills System: Automatic skill loading based on role and phase
- Memory System: Learning-based improvements through feedback loops
- MCP Integrations: Jira, GitHub, Figma, Chrome DevTools, PostgreSQL
- One-Command Setup: Automated installation and initialization
- Slash Commands: 27+ commands for workflow management

PHASE SYSTEM
Phase 1 (PRD): Transform raw requirements into PRD document with user stories
Phase 2 (Tech Spec): Create architecture, schemas, API contracts from PRD
Phase 3 (Breakdown): Create Jira epics/stories/tasks from Tech Spec
Phase 4 (Development): Write tests first (TDD), then implement features
Phase 5 (QA & Ship): Testing, code review, deployment preparation

Each phase has entry criteria, required work, exit criteria, and artifacts.

TECHNOLOGY STACK
Frontend: Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, SCSS
Backend: Node.js 18+, Next.js API Routes
Database: PostgreSQL 16+
Testing: Jest, Testing Library, Supertest, Puppeteer
Authentication: JWT + bcryptjs
Deployment: Docker, Docker Compose

KEY SYSTEMS

Phase Gates (phase-enforcement skill)
- Reads .aid/state.json to check current phase
- Refuses work that belongs to future phases
- Enforces sequential progression

Work Context Tracking (context-tracking skill)
- Maintains .aid/context.json with task/step tracking
- Tracks previous/current/next tasks
- Tracks previous/current/next steps within tasks
- Session logging for continuity

Memory System (learning-based improvements)
- Collects feedback at end of each phase
- Detects patterns in feedback
- Updates skills based on patterns
- Promotes insights to Claude Memory for cross-session learning
- 30 slots in Claude Memory (roles: PM/Dev/QA/Lead, phases, universal)

SLASH COMMANDS

Daily Workflow:
  /good-morning - Morning startup, load context, check MCPs
  /context - Show current task and step
  /context-update - Update context manually

Phase Management:
  /aid-init - Initialize new project
  /aid-start - Start work session with role selection
  /aid-status - Show current state
  /aid-end - End phase with feedback
  /phase - Show current phase status
  /gate-check - Check if ready to advance
  /phase-approve - Get human sign-off
  /phase-advance - Move to next phase

Development:
  /prd - Generate PRD from requirements
  /tech-spec - Create technical specification

STATE FILES
.aid/state.json      - Phase state (which phase we're in)
.aid/context.json    - Work context (current task, step, progress)
.aid/approvals/      - Approval markers for phase gates
~/.aid/state.json    - Session state (role, phase, session info)
~/.aid/feedback/     - Feedback for learning system

MCP INTEGRATIONS
Atlassian (Jira/Confluence) - Project management via OAuth
GitHub - Repository operations and version control
Figma - Design token extraction and component documentation
Chrome DevTools - Browser automation, testing, performance
PostgreSQL - Direct database query access
Filesystem - File operations and project access

3. /prd user-auth → Create PRD for feature
4. /phase-approve → Get approval
5. /phase-advance → Move to Phase 2
6. /tech-spec user-auth → Create architecture
7. /phase-approve → Get approval
8. /phase-advance → Move to Phase 3
9. /jira-breakdown → Create Jira issues
10. /phase-approve → Get approval
11. /phase-advance → Move to Phase 4 (code allowed)
12. /context → See current task
13. [Implement feature, tests first]
14. /context-update → Update progress
15. /phase-advance → Move to Phase 5
16. /test-review → Review test coverage
