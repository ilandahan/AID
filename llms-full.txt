1. INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

WHAT IS AID?

AID (AI Development Methodology) is a comprehensive framework for building
production-quality software with Claude Code. It systematizes the entire journey
from raw requirements to deployment through:

- Enforced phase gates that prevent out-of-order work
- Context tracking that maintains continuity across sessions
- Skills system that auto-loads relevant expertise by role and phase
- Memory system that learns from feedback and improves over time
- MCP integrations with industry tools (Jira, GitHub, Figma, etc.)

TARGET USERS
- Solo developers building with Claude Code
- Teams using Claude for code generation
- Projects requiring structured methodology
- Organizations needing audit trails and phase gates

KEY PRINCIPLES
1. Sequential progression through phases (no skipping)
2. Clear entry/exit criteria for each phase
3. Real-time context preservation (never lose your place)
4. TDD-first development (tests before code)
5. Human approval gates (AI assistance, human decisions)
6. Continuous learning (feedback drives improvement)

================================================================================
2. PHASE SYSTEM
================================================================================

OVERVIEW

The phase system enforces sequential development through 5 stages:

Phase 1 (PRD) --> Gate --> Phase 2 (Tech Spec) --> Gate --> Phase 3 (Breakdown)
    --> Gate --> Phase 4 (Development) --> Gate --> Phase 5 (QA & Ship)

Each phase has:
- Entry Criteria: What must exist to start
- Required Work: What happens in this phase
- Exit Criteria: What must be complete to advance
- Artifacts: Files produced
- Phase Enforcement: What work is allowed/blocked

PHASE 1: PRD (Product Requirements Document)
